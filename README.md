## Introduction
The goal of this project is to enhance the functionality of the Ibanez AEG10 acoustic guitar by integrating a built-in speaker system. This modification allows for on-the-go amplification without the need for external speakers, making it convenient for practice and small performances.

## Materials and Tools
### Materials
- Ibanez AEG10 acoustic guitar
- Miniature speakers
- Amplifier circuit board
- Rechargeable battery pack
- Wiring kit
- 3D printed or custom-made speaker mounts
- Switches and volume control knobs

### Tools
- Soldering iron and solder
- Wire cutters/strippers
- Drill and appropriate bits
- Screwdrivers
- Multimeter
- 3D printer (if custom mounts are being printed)

## Modifications
### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Preparation**
   - Ensure the guitar is in a clean and stable work environment.
   - Remove the strings and any detachable components to avoid damage.

2. **Planning the Layout**
   - Determine the best locations for the speakers within the guitar body.
   - Plan the routing of the wires and placement of the amplifier and battery pack.

3. **Drilling and Cutting**
   - Carefully drill holes for the speakers and any controls on the guitar body.
   - Smooth the edges of the holes to prevent damage to the components.

4. **Mounting the Speakers**
   - Install the speakers into the prepared mounts.
   - Securely attach the mounts inside the guitar body.

5. **Wiring**
   - Solder the wires to connect the speakers to the amplifier circuit.
   - Connect the battery pack and test the circuit with a multimeter to ensure proper connections.

6. **Final Assembly**
   - Secure all components inside the guitar.
   - Reassemble the guitar and restring it.

7. **Testing**
   - Turn on the system and test the sound quality.
   - Make any necessary adjustments to the wiring or component placement.

## Schematics and Diagrams
All relevant schematics and diagrams for the wiring and component placement are located in the `schematics` directory.

## Testing and Tuning
After assembly, thorough testing is essential to ensure the modifications work correctly. Adjust the volume controls, check the battery life, and test the sound output.

## Maintenance
Regular maintenance involves checking the battery, ensuring connections remain secure, and cleaning the components as needed.
